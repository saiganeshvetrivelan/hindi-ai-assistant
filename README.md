# hindi-ai-assistant
This repository offers a full implementation of an offline Hindi voice assistant that can be efficiently executed on a Raspberry Pi. The project aims to provide a natural voice interface that does not require cloud connectivity, making it ideal for environments with poor connectivity.

The voice assistant is designed to listen to voice commands from a microphone, transcribe the voice commands into text using a simplified speech recognition algorithm, process the user’s command, and finally respond accordingly. The assistant can be used to perform simple tasks such as answering questions, executing system commands, or performing actions based on voice commands. The assistant is optimized to provide fast responses with high accuracy, even on resource-constrained hardware.

The code is organized in a clean and organized manner, separating different modules such as handling audio input, speech-to-text processing, command processing, and response generation. This allows for easy understanding, modification, and customization of the code for different applications. The code also includes setup instructions and dependencies to facilitate the easy implementation of the voice assistant on the user’s system.

This project showcases the possibility of creating an efficient offline voice assistant using state-of-the-art AI models and embedded systems for real-time Hindi voice interaction.
